Programming Assignment 2

Required Functions:

makeCacheMatrix: Function creates a special matrix object that can cache its inverse.

cacheSolve: Function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.

Assumptions: The matrix supplied is always invertible.

Assignment/Submittal Requirements:

1. Fork GitHub repository containing stub R files: https://github.com/rdpeng/ProgrammingAssignment2 ; create copy.
2. Clone forked GitHub repository to local machine to enable editing.
3. Edit R file contained in the git repository and place solution in assigned file.
4. Commit completed R file into "cartapisana" repository; push git branch to "cartapisana" GitHub repository.
5. Submit to Coursera the URL to GitHub repository containing the completed R code.
6. Submit 40 character SHA-1 hash identifying the final repository commit.
